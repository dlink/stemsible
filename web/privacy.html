    <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
    
    <h4>Last updated: August 08, 2016</h4>
      
    <p>We are a social network and online platform for parents, teachers, and administrators.</p>
    
    <p>Stemsible's mission is simple: To empower parents, teachers, and administrators to improve our children's learning, growth, and social outcomes. Our registered users ("Members") share their school preferences, engage with their network, exchange information and knowledge, post and view relevant content, and find learning and growth knowledge. None of our content is visible to unregistered users ("visitors"). We believe that our services allow our Members to effectively gather ideas and information on ways to improve their children's learning and growth potential. The cornerstone of our initiative is to focus on our Members first.</p>

    <h4>We protect your personal information using industry-standard safeguards.</h4>
    
    <h4>We may share your information with your consent or as required by law, and we will always let you know when we make significant changes to this Privacy Policy.</h4>

    <li>We have implemented appropriate security safeguards designed to protect your information in accordance with industry standards.</li>
