    <p class='list-header'>2. Profile</p>
    <p class='ques'> How do I change (update, add, delete) my school relationships?</p>
    <p class='ans'> You can do this from your <a href="/profile.py">profile page</a>. Just log into Stemsible, then click on your name on the top right corner, and you will be in the profile page. Here you will be able to view and edit the school relationships.</p>
    <p class='ques'> I do not see my school in the list. How do I add/request it?</p>
    <p class='ans'> We are adding new schools and county/districts on a daily basis. If you can't find your school in the current list, go ahead and just type it in. Alternately, you can <a href="mailto:info@stemsible.com?Subject=New%20School">email</a> the following information to info@stemsible.com and we will add the school within 1 business day - school name, school county/district, school address (street address, city, state, country, zip/pin code), school type (Pre-K, Elementary, Middle, High). We may need to follow-up with you for additional clarification.</p>
    <p class='ques'> My school info is incorrect (spelling, etc.). How do I correct it?</p>

    <p class='list-header'>News Feed</p>
    <p class='ques'> How does News Feed work?</p>
    <p class='ans'> News Feed on your home page are constantly updated. News Feed includes questions/answers, school updates, advice/tips, discussion threads, and influential news/research items shared by parents, teachers, school administrators, and by you.</p>
    <p class='ques'> How does News Feed decide which updates and articles to show?</p>
    <p class='ans'> The stories that show in your News Feed are influenced by your school preferences (grades, level, county/district). This helps you see updates that are relevant to you from parents, teachers, and local administrators. Also, if your school preferences include an "interest in another school", the News Feed will also include updates from that specific school(s).</p>
    <p class='ques'> Why am I seeing updates from people from other schools, cities, or counties/districts?</p>
    <p class='ans'> You see updates in your News Feed from other schools, cities, or counties/districts because of one of two reasons - (1) there aren't enough parents, teachers, and/or administrators on Stemsible from your local area or (2) you have expressed an "interest in another school".</p>

    <p class='list-header'>Posting</p>
    <p class='ques'> How do I share a link/URL on Stemsible?</p>
    <p class='ans'> You can share a link/URL by simply copy/paste or type the URL (www....) within your update/message. As soon the URL is typed, a preview box will pop-up right under the message. Once you POST the update/message, the message content along with the URL preview will show up in your News Feed as well as the News Feed of other parents, teachers, and administrators that are from you grade, school, or county/district. The update will also show up in the News Feed of the parents that have an "interest in your school".</p>
    <p class='ques'> How do I edit a post I have shared?</p>
    <p class='ans'> Stemsible doesn't support this feature at this time but we are working on adding it in the very near future.</p>
    <p class='ques'> How do I delete a post I have shared?</p>
    <p class='ans'> Stemsible doesn't support this feature at this time but we are working on adding it in the very near future.</p>
    <p class='ques'> Who can see my posts?</p>
    <p class='ans'> All of the parents, teachers, and administrators that share your school preferences will see your posts as well as parents who have an "interest in your school".</p>
    <p class='ques'> Who can like and comment on my posts?</p>
    <p class='ans'> Anybody who can see your post (see prior Q&A) can like or comment on your post.</p>

    <p class='list-header'>Pricing</p>
    <p class='ques'> Do I have to pay to sign-up on Stemsible?</p>
    <p class='ans'> Stemsible will always be free to individual users like parents, teachers, and county/district administrators.</p>
    <p class='ques'> Will Stemsible charge me later for being a user?</p>
    <p class='ans'> Stemsible will never charge a parent, teacher, or county/district administrator at anytime.</p>

    <p class='list-header'>Reporting Something</p>
    <p class='ques'> How do I report malicious activity or derogatory content?</p>
    <p class='ans'> Please <a href="mailto:info@stemsible.com?Subject=Malicious%20Activity">email</a> the offender user name and any other information about the update/post to info@stemsible.com and we will take suitable action (including removing the post from News Feed) immediately.
